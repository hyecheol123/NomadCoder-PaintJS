# NomadCoder-PaintJS

Clone Coding Repository for "JavaScript for Beginner 2" Course of NomadCoder

Lecture Link: https://nomadcoders.co/javascript-for-beginners-2

- Lecture Language: English (Administrated in Korean)

## Purpose / Goal

- To recap JavaScript basics and be familiar with some JavaScript functions
  and HTML components that will use frequently in websites.
- At the end of the course, I am expected to build a simple painting board.

## What I Learn

- [**Canvas API**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API)
  is used to draw graphics with JavaScript
  - Use [**HTMLCanvasElement.getContext(\<contextType\>)**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement/getContext) to get drawing context on the canvas.
    - If we use `2d` for `contextType`, the function will return [**CanvasRenderingContext2D**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D).
      Follow the link to see the available drawing functions of `CanvasRenderingContext2D`.
  - Save Canvas as a image by using [**HTMLCanvasElement.toDataURL()**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement/toDataURL).
- `a` tag can have `download` attribute, which makes users not to navigate to the URL but to download the linked URL.
  - It should contains link of the file in `href` attribute, and `download` attribute should have file name.
